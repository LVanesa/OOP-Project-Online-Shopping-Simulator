Gucci Bloom/ This reminds me of the Empress card in the tarot. Luminous, lush, potent, and richly feminine./ 4
Chanel No.5/ I absolutely love this perfume. It’s deep and cosy without losing its lightness and freshness./ 4
Gucci Bloom/ This was the first perfume I ever purchased, I fell in love with it immediately./ 5
Dior Sauvage/ If you're looking for a crowd pleasing scent, this is it. I personally prefer more unique scents on a man, but it's not a bad fragrance at all./ 4
Dior Sauvage/ Ambroxan and pepper bomb this thing is. It's a projection beast but the smell ain't anything special./ 2
Chanel No.5/ I'm not the biggest fan of Chanel No 5. Yes, it's a classic fragrance, but I couldn't get past its overt artifciality./ 1
Gucci Bloom/ It smells beautiful after 3 hours, but I don’t want to wait 3 hours to actually love my perfume, so this won’t be in my collection./ 2
Dior Sauvage/ Extremely run of the mill scent. Nothing particularly unique stands out about this./ 1
Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium/ I've got it for years now and since then I'm trying to like it. But somehow I don't really do../ 1
Black XS/ Quite sweet but still with the Jovanovich vibe./ 3
Black XS/ Lovely fragrance but very weak./3
Libre Le Parfum/ When I first smelled this I was hooked!/5
Poison Dior/ This smells like gardenias and ashtray water. I had to rush home to shower because it gave me a migraine almost immediately./1
When the Rain Stops/This scent is incredibly nostalgic and beautiful./5
Lust for Sun/This... was a letdown, unfortunately./2
Lust for Sun/The opening smells exactly like Coco Vanille by Mancera but the dry down smells like Gucci Bloom. Tuberose isn’t listed but I swear I smell it./4
Tobacco Vanille/ A Sensual and Sophisticated Journey/5
Tom Ford Black Orchid/ Beautiful, intriguing, mysterious and unique, with hidden depths and perhaps dark secrets - that’s both the fragrance and the wearer.Sublime perfumery./5
