# **OOP PROJECT - ONLINE SHOPPING SIMULATION APP**

### DESCRIPTION :page_with_curl: :pencil2:
This C++ project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course during my first year at FMI @unibuc. Its primary objective was to integrate fundamental OOP concepts and simulate real-world scenarios, leading to its development in three distinct stages, each serving a specific purpose and building upon the previous one.

Enriched with my passion for fragrances, the project was customized to emulate the immersive experience of shopping for perfumes in a virtual environment. Users interact with the application through a console menu interface, allowing them to browse products, add items to their cart, manage their orders, and perform other shopping-related tasks.

### :blossom:[STAGE I](https://github.com/LVanesa/Proiect---POO/tree/main/Etapa%20I):

In the initial phase, the primary objective was to establish the project's foundational elements by creating a few initial classes such as Product, Date, Order, ShoppingCart, and User. This stage aimed to master dynamic memory allocation (i.e. working with pointers to data/objects, and arrays of pointers). Consequently, classes from the STL library (such as vector, string) were not utilized. Here, the groundwork for the application's business logic was laid, paving the way for subsequent development phases.

The second stage marked a progression to more advanced OOP concepts, including inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, and exceptions. This phase involved implementing complex features and refining the project's architecture. Through polymorphism and virtual methods, I enhanced the application's flexibility and extensibility. The emphasis was on building a solid structure capable of accommodating future improvements and modifications.

In the final stage, the project was brought to completion by introducing additional functionalities and optimizing its design. A singleton menu design pattern was adopted to streamline testing and improve user interaction. Template methods were integrated to parse data from external files, enhancing the application's realism and usability. This phase aimed to refine the project's codebase, ensuring robustness, maintainability, and scalability.

Through these iterative stages, the project evolved from a basic concept into a comprehensive online shopping simulation app. Each stage deepened my understanding of OOP principles, improved my programming skills, and showcased my ability to develop practical software solutions in line with industry standards.
